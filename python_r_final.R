#numerical with 2 values (1 or -1), we have done the same with higher and with absence since its a numeric variable 
#from 0 to 93 (the number of absences) we cut the variable in 5 breaks and we assign 5 to who made a lot of absences
#to 1 who made few of them. then we revers the orders of the value and create the variable_sintetica as 
#5 breaks+1 - breaks
#then the variable student_commitment we summed those variables and we multipled studytime by 2 
#because we gave more importance to the time spent studying and doing so we can see that students who have the highest 
#points on student_commitment have at the same time the higher average grade. (the point go from 4 to 15)
